<p>Mr. Krabs bought a used self-serve ice cream machine for the Krusty Krab that serves ice cream through a Go program... After just one day of use, the ice cream machine broke down, just like in every other fast food restaurant!</p>
<p>As usual, Mr. Krabs doesn't want to spend any money on a "broken ice cream machine" sign. Please help him create the main error message and a wrapped error message within the <code class="language-go">brokenMessage</code> function with the following contents: </p>
<ul>
<li>main error: <em>"ice cream machine is broken"</em></li>
<li>wrapped error: <em>"error: can't serve you an ice cream main cause of error:"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Take notice that the error message will automatically show up when customers try to use the machine and input the flavor of the ice cream they want:</p>
